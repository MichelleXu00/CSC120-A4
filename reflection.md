- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

I have to consider if each method should be public or private before writing and make a accessor for the private methods. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I become more familiar with writing code in java. I encoutered some trouble with using methods and declaring & using variables in java. I would recommend to fully understand the purpose of each class before start writing code.
